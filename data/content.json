The Apostles&rsquo; Creed expresses what we believe in these words: We believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord, who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into hell. The third day he rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from there he will come to judge the living and the dead. We believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.</p>",

Answer: To whatever we look for any good thing and for refuge in every need, that is what is meant by &lsquo;god&rsquo;&hellip;it is the trust and faith of the heart, nothing else, that make both God and an idol&hellip;. To whatever you give your heart and entrust your being, that&hellip;is really your god&hellip;. Many a person imagines that he has God and everything he needs, provided he has money and property. He relies upon these, boasts about them, and feels&hellip;immovably secure&hellip;. But look, he too has a god, named mammon, that is the money and property to which he has given his whole heart. Mammon is the world&rsquo;s favorite idol. One who has money and property has a sense of security and feels&hellip;happy and fearless&hellip;. On the other hand, one who has nothing is as insecure and anxiety-ridden as if he had never heard of God&hellip;. Similarly, one who congratulates himself on his great learning, intelligence, power, special advantages, family connections, and honor and trusts in them also has a god, only not the one true God. The evidence for this appears when people are arrogant, secure, and proud because of such possessions, but desperate when they lack them or lose them. I repeat, to have a god means to have something on which one&rsquo;s heart depends entirely.</p><p class='commentary__body'>So now you can easily understand what it is and how much it is that this [first] commandment requires. It requires that man&rsquo;s whole heart and all his confidence be given to God alone and no one else&hellip;. The true worship and service of God, the kind that pleases Him and which He also commands on pain of everlasting wrath&hellip;takes place when your heart directs all its trust and confidence only toward God and does not let itself be torn away from Him; it consists in risking everything on earth for Him and abandoning it all for His sake. You can easily judge how, in contrast to this, the world practices nothing but false worship and idolatry&hellip;. Everyone has set up for himself some particular god to which he looks for benefits, help, and comfort&hellip;. For idolatry does not consist simply in setting up an image and worshiping it; it takes place primarily in the heart, which looks elsewhere than to the one God, seeks help and comfort in created things&hellip;. Besides this there is also that false worship, that height of idolatry, which&hellip;involves&hellip;those who seek comfort and salvation in their own works and presume to capture heaven by putting God under the pressure of an obligation&hellip;, they wish to earn everything themselves or merit it by works&hellip;. What is this but turning God into an idol, into a plaster image, while the worshiper actually is setting himself up as his own god. However:&hellip;We are to trust in God alone, look to Him, and expect to receive nothing but good things from Him&hellip;. Question and explore your own heart thoroughly, and you will find out if it embraces God alone or not. Do you have it in your heart to expect nothing but good things from God, especially when you are in trouble and in need? And does your heart in addition give up and forsake everything that is not God? Then you have the one true God. On the other hand, is your heart attached to and does it rely on something else, from which you hope to receive more good and more help than from God? And when things go wrong, do you, instead of fleeing to Him, flee from Him? Then you have another god, a false god, [an idol].&rdquo;</p>",

Memory looks back upon past sins, with deep sorrow for the sin, but yet with no dread of any penalty to come; for Christ has paid the debt of his people to the last jot and tittle, and received the divine receipt; and unless God can be so unjust as to demand double payment for one debt, no soul for whom Jesus died as a substitute can ever be cast into hell. It seems to be one of the very principles of our enlightened nature to believe that God is just; we feel that it must be so, and this gives us our terror at first; but is it not marvellous that this very same belief that God is just, becomes afterwards the pillar of our confidence and peace! If God is just, I, a sinner, alone and without a substitute, must be punished; but Jesus stands in my place and is punished for me; and now, if God is just, I, a sinner, standing in Christ, can never be punished. God must change his nature before one soul for whom Jesus was a substitute can ever by any possibility suffer the lash of the law. Therefore, Jesus having taken the place of the believer&mdash;having rendered a full equivalent to divine wrath for all that his people ought to have suffered as the result of sin, the believer can shout with glorious triumph, &ldquo;Who shall lay anything to the charge of God&rsquo;s elect?&rdquo; Not God, for he has justified; not Christ, for he has died, &ldquo;yes rather has risen again.&rdquo; My hope does not live because I am not a sinner, but because I am a sinner for whom Christ died; my trust is not that I am holy, but that being unholy, he is my righteousness.

It cannot possibly provide what is lacking with the absence of repentance to God, and faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ. It is an ordinance for the penitent, not for the impenitent,&mdash;for the believing, not for the unbelieving,&mdash;for the converted, not for the unconverted. The unconverted man, who fancies that be can find a shortcut road to heaven by taking the Sacrament, without treading the well-worn steps of repentance and faith, will find to his cost one day that he is totally deceived. The Lord&rsquo;s Supper was meant to increase and help the grace that a man has, but not to impart the grace that he has not.

The simplest statement of the benefit which a truehearted communicant may expect to receive from the Lord&rsquo;s Supper&hellip;is the strengthening and refreshing of our souls. Clearer views of Christ and His atonement, clearer views of all the offices which Christ fills as our Mediator and Advocate, clearer views of the complete redemption Christ has obtained for us by His vicarious death on the cross, clearer views of our full and perfect acceptance in Christ before God, fresh reasons for deep repentance for sin, fresh reasons for lively faith, fresh reasons for living a holy, consecrated, Christ-like life,&mdash;these are among the leading returns which a believer may confidently expect to get from his attendance at the Lord&rsquo;s Table.

Drinking that wine by faith, he will feel closer communion with the blood of Christ. He will see more clearly what Christ is to him, and what he is to Christ.

And in between, the perspective is overshadowed by this Alpha and Omega, this Beginning and End. The first outspoken expression of this is God&rsquo;s word in Isaiah 65: &lsquo;Behold, I will create new heavens and a new earth&rsquo; (v.17). Then Jesus himself spoke of the palingenesia, literally &lsquo;the new birth,&rsquo; but translated by the NIV &lsquo;the renewal of all things&rsquo; (Matt. 19:28). In the rest of the New Testament the three major apostolic authors (Paul, Peter, and John) all allude to the same theme. Paul writes that the whole creation will one day be liberated from its bondage to pain and decay (Rom. 8:18&ndash;25). Peter prophesies that the present heavens will be replaced by a new heaven and earth, which will be the home of righteousness and peace (2 Pet. 3:7&ndash;13). Next, John writes that he saw the same replacement, together with the New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God (Rev. 21:1&ndash;2). And in the same chapter John writes that the kings of the earth and the nations will bring their glory into the city, though &lsquo;nothing impure will ever enter into it&rsquo; (Rev. 21:27). We need to be cautious in our interpretation of these verses, but they seem to mean that human culture will not all be destroyed but, once purged of every taint of evil, will be preserved to beautify the New Jerusalem. To sum up, just as in the resurrection of the body, so in the renewal of the universe, the old will not all be destroyed but will be transformed. This is our living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.&rdquo;</p>",
